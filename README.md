# RNAonGraph: a graph representational learning approach for RNAs
This is a repository dedicated to neural representational learning of RNA secondary structures.

Prior to this date, the imputation of RNA secondary structures has formed an important line of investigation in the community of computational molecular biology, and various folding algorithms have been developed to make more accurate and more efficient predictions.

However, due to the highly stochastic nature of RNA folding and the uncertainty that arise thereof, the global structural characterization of slighly longer RNA molecules has been an unsatisfactory, although one may argue that their local structures would suffice the need of extracting interesting signals correlated with functions.

Then, a follow-up question is, how to more effectively learn a representation of RNA secondary structures, local or global, and how to adequately extract signals from these structures.

To answer this question, we seek an end-to-end learning approach directly defined on RNA graphs, enabled by a more general framework called graph neural nets that has been recently adpated to other biological and chemical domains.
